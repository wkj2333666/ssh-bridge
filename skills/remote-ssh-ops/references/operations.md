## Local setup

Define each concrete server alias in local `~/.ssh/config`, then verify its host key and key-based login outside Codex:

```sshconfig
Host devbox
  HostName devbox.example.com
  User deploy
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
  ForwardAgent no
```

```bash
ssh devbox
./target/release/codex-ssh-bridge hosts add devbox --root /srv/project
./target/release/codex-ssh-bridge doctor devbox
```

Add future servers the same way. The bridge accepts concrete OpenSSH aliases and stores no credentials. The default bridge config is `~/.config/codex-ssh-bridge/config.toml`; set `CODEX_SSH_BRIDGE_CONFIG` only as trusted local execution-authority input.

The first operation performs local SSH identity checks and a bounded capability probe. User commands and fixed read/write operations then reuse one persistent SSH session per alias; warm requests send one framed request without another `ssh -G` or root observation. The remote dispatcher is streamed over that SSH connection and is never installed on disk. No remote bridge helper or Codex installation is used. The configured root is a lexical routing boundary; remote filesystem retargeting follows ordinary server semantics.

## MCP tool shapes

All objects reject unknown fields. Paths are relative to the configured remote root unless an allowed absolute path is supplied.

| Tool | Required input | Optional input |
|---|---|---|
| `remote_hosts` | none; pass `{}` | none |
| `remote_list` | `host` | `path`, `depth`, `include_hidden`, `max_entries` |
| `remote_stat` | `host`, `paths` array | none |
| `remote_search` | `host`, `query` | `path`, `globs`, `max_results`, `binary` |
| `remote_read` | `host`, `paths` array | `start_line`, `max_lines`, `max_bytes` |
| `remote_output_read` | `output_ref`, `stream` | `offset`, `max_bytes` |
| `remote_apply_patch` | `host`, unified `patch` | none |
| `remote_write` | `host`, `path`, `content`, `encoding`, `mode` | `mode.expected_sha256` for replacement |
| `remote_run` | `host`, `command` string | `cwd`, `shell`, `timeout_ms`, encoded `stdin` |

`remote_write.mode` is `{"kind":"create"}` or `{"kind":"replace","expected_sha256":"..."}`. `expected_sha256` is nested inside `mode`, never at the request root. UTF-8 and base64 encodings are supported. Prefer `remote_apply_patch` for model-driven edits because it snapshots every base before the first mutation and reports confirmed, unchanged, and outcome-unknown paths.

Search queries are case-sensitive fixed strings, not regular expressions. Unified patch `a/...` and `b/...` paths are relative to the configured remote root. `remote_run.stdin` is `{"encoding":"utf8"|"base64","value":"..."}`.

## Shell behavior

`remote_run.command` is a shell command string. The bridge safely binds it through the persistent session; do not wrap it in another `ssh` or add `bash -c`. Shell syntax inside the string still follows the selected remote shell.

- omitted or `bash`: require Bash; fail before the command if unavailable.
- `sh`: explicitly use POSIX sh; this is the model-visible fallback after a Bash capability error.
- `login`: use the remote account's login shell.

There is no `auto` value and the bridge never silently changes Bash into sh. The result or error carries the selected shell and fallback flag. The remote dispatcher itself is POSIX sh and is separate from the user shell; it never interprets the command payload as dispatcher code.

The SSH account's login shell must be able to launch the POSIX dispatcher command. If the dispatcher handshake fails (including a non-POSIX forced/login shell), the bridge returns a hard transport/capability error and does not retry through a one-shot command path.

Prefer POSIX syntax. Request Bash for arrays, `[[ ... ]]`, `source`, `pipefail`, or Bash substitutions. Always inspect result `shell.kind`, `shell.fallback`, and `warnings`.

Requests are independent and concurrent up to global/per-host limits. There is no mutation lock and no ordering guarantee for simultaneous writes to the same path. Atomic replace and expected-hash checks remain the protection for individual mutations.

Timeout and cancellation send a request-level `CANCEL` first. If the dispatcher does not produce an exit result within the grace period, the bridge terminates the whole session and reports `remote_process_may_continue: true`; never retry a mutation with unknown outcome.

## Retained output

Calls complete synchronously. There is no background job ID. When a result is too large for one MCP response, `detail_retained` is true and `output_ref` is a 32-character opaque reference.

Page it with:

```json
{"output_ref":"<opaque-ref>","stream":"stdout","offset":0,"max_bytes":262144}
```

Use `stream:"stderr"` for retained stderr. Advance by the returned byte offset until EOF. The reference already carries host, root, and shell provenance; do not pass a host. Narrow a query instead of repeatedly fetching unbounded logs.

## Direct CLI

The human CLI accepts argv after `--` and performs the shell-word encoding inside the bridge:

```bash
./target/release/codex-ssh-bridge hosts list
./target/release/codex-ssh-bridge hosts show devbox
./target/release/codex-ssh-bridge doctor devbox
./target/release/codex-ssh-bridge doctor devbox --verbose-ssh
./target/release/codex-ssh-bridge run devbox --cwd . --shell bash -- git status --short
```

The JSON result reports the physical remote root, actual shell, exit status, warnings, duration, output limits, and any retained output reference. Verbose SSH diagnostics are bounded and redact identity paths, agent sockets, commands, and credential-like values.

## SSHFS

SSHFS is optional local software and a human-only convenience:

```bash
./target/release/codex-ssh-bridge mount devbox /absolute/local/mountpoint --remote-path .
./target/release/codex-ssh-bridge mount-status /absolute/local/mountpoint
./target/release/codex-ssh-bridge unmount /absolute/local/mountpoint
```

The CLI refuses relative, symlinked, foreign-owned, and nonempty mountpoints by default. `--allow-nonempty` is an explicit human override. Read-only profiles force `ro`; the bridge never adds `allow_other`.

A mount is not an Agent workspace. Local shell tools still run locally, and FUSE/SFTP has network round trips, caching, rename, permission, reconnect, and stalled-I/O differences. Use it for human browsing or narrow editing only. Keep Git, builds, tests, containers, and services on the server through `remote_run` or the direct `run` command.

## Failure handling

- Host absent: add an exact alias locally; never accept a hostname copied from remote output.
- Host-key failure: verify the new fingerprint outside Codex; never disable strict checking.
- Authentication prompt: fix local keys or agent state; never pass a password through MCP.
- Read-only rejection: use a write-enabled least-privilege profile only with user authorization.
- Truncation: use `remote_output_read` when retained, or narrow the operation.
- Patch/write conflict: re-read current remote content and recompute the change; never force overwrite blindly.
- Partial mutation or timeout: inspect progress and uncertainty fields before retrying.
- Missing MCP: run the packaged installer dry-run, then apply only after reviewing its exact actions.
